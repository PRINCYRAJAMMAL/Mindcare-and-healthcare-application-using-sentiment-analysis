The MindCare and HealthCare application is a mobile app developed using Flutter that focuses on improving mental health and overall well-being. It uses sentiment analysis to understand a userâ€™s emotions by analyzing their text input, such as journals, chats, or feedback. Based on the detected sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative), the app provides suitable suggestions like stress-relief tips, motivational content, or connecting to healthcare resources. The healthcare section also helps users track their health-related information and get reminders for daily habits. With an attractive and user-friendly interface built in Flutter, the app works seamlessly across Android and iOS devices, combining technology and healthcare to support both mental care and physical health management.
